## 0.6.1 / 2017-02-08

*   Fixed an issue where `bin/minitar` was not loading zlib for compressed
    files.

## 0.6 / 2017-02-07

*   Hello, minitar-cli. This is a new gem containing code originally from
    archive-tar-minitar.

*   Enhancements:

    *   Extracted `bin/minitar` from [minitar][].
    *   Replaced Satoru Takabayashiâ€™s [Ruby Progress Bar][] with
        [busyloop/powerbar][].
    *   Added filename filtering to `minitar list`.

*   Bugs:

    *   Fixed a problem where `bin/minitar create` would not include dotfiles
        on Unix systems.

*   Development:

    *   Modernized minitar tooling around Hoe.
    *   Added travis and coveralls.
