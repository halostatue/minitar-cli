# Changelog

## NEXT / 2025-MM-DD

- Governance:

  Changes described here are effective 2024-12-31.

  - Update gem management details to use markdown files for everything, enabled
    in part by [flavorjones/hoe-markdown][hoe-markdown]. Several files were
    renamed to be more consistent with standard practices.

  - Updated security notes with an [age][age] public key rather than pointing to
    Keybase.io and a PGP public key which I no longer use. The use of the
    [Tidelift security contact][tidelift] is recommended over direct disclosure.

  Changes described below are effective 2025-08-04.
