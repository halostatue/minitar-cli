# minitar-cli Security Policy

minitar-cli aims to be secure by default. The supported commands (`create`,
`list`, and `extract`) accept input from standard input (when provided `-`) or a
filename, where the string provided is treated as a filename.

For security issues arising from the _contents_ of a tarball should be reported
for [minitar][minitar].

## LLM-Generated Security Report Policy

Absolutely no security reports will be accepted that have been generated by LLM
agents.

## Supported Versions

Security reports are accepted only for the most recent major release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

By preference, use the [Tidelift security contact][tidelift]. Tidelift will
coordinate the fix and disclosure.

Alternatively, create a [private vulnerability report][advisory] with GitHub or
send an email to [security@ruby.halostatue.ca][email] with the text
`minitar-cli` in the subject. Emails sent to this address should be encrypted
using [age][age] with the following public key:

```
