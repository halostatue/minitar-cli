# minitar-cli Security Policy

minitar-cli aims to be secure by default. The supported commands (`create`,
`list`, and `extract`) accept input from standard input (when provided `-`) or a
filename, where the string provided is treated as a filename.

For security issues arising from the _contents_ of a tarball should be reported
for [minitar][minitar].

## LLM-Generated Security Report Policy

Absolutely no security reports will be accepted that have been generated by LLM
agents.

## Supported Versions

Security reports are accepted only for the most recent major release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report vulnerabilities via the [Tidelift security contact][tidelift]. Tidelift
will coordinate the fix and disclosure.

Alternatively, create a [private vulnerability report][advisory] with GitHub.
